        List of member Device IDs.

        This field is read-only after scene creation.
        Use the Scene Devices endpoint's POST/DELETE
        methods to add/remove Devices and Groups from the Scene,
        or the PATCH endpoint to change the Action or Argument,
        or to change the execution order.
      type: array
      example:
        - ["aabbccdd", "TurnLightOff", ""]
        - ["11223344", "SetSpeed", "1"]
        - ["deadbeef", "Close", ""]
    type:
      readOnly: true

        For values, see `type` field of Device schema.

        Type is automatically set by the Bond Bridge to be the type of the
        underlying devices when all devices are of the same type. Note that
        Scene type is always an array, even if it has zero or one element.

        When devies of multiple types are mixed in a single Scene,
        this `type` lists each type.
        For example, a Ceiling Fan (CF) and a Light (LT) combined would be
        ["CF", "LT"] (with the order being aribitrary).
      example:
        - "MS"
      type: array
    location:
      readOnly: true
      example:
         - Kitchen
      type: array
      description: |
        Similar to `type`, if all Devices in the Scene are in the same Location,
        this field will be an array with a single string. However, when Devices
        from multiple Locations are combined in one Scene, this field lists
        each unique Location in arbitrary order.
    actions:
      readOnly: true
      type: array
      example:
        - "Activate"
      description: |
        Scenes always have exactly one action called "Activate".
    state:
      readOnly: true
      type: object
      example:
        _: "ad9bcde4"
        "active": true
  required:
  - name

SceneList:
  type: object
  example:
    _: "7fc1e84b"
    3b20f300:
        _: "9a5e1136"
    4caf6472:
        _: "409d124b"
State:
  example:
    active: true

SceneDevice:
  properties:
    device:
      example: "aabbccdd"
      type: string
      description: |
        ID of Device or Group.
    action:
      example: "SetSpeed"
      type: string
      description: |
        Action to run on Device or Group
    argument:
      example: "2"
      type: string
      description: |
        Argument for Action, if required. (JSON rendered as string)
    order:
      example: 10000
      type: integer
      description: |
        If not provided, order of a new Scene Device is the highest
        order of other Scene Devices plus 10000.

        When activating a Scene, Bond Bridge executes device actions
        with lowest order first. This order is only ensured within a single
        Bridge. For Scenes that span multiple Bridges, Scenes including SBB
        devices, some concurrent execution will occur.

        The order should be used by the client to enforce display order
        in Scene editing. However, care should be taken with this UX
        when multiple Bonds are involved, due to the concurrent execution
        and irrelevence of the order in that case.
