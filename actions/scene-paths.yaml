  summary: Activate a Scene
  description: |
    `action_name` must be "Activate". In other words,
    a Scene supports exactly one action called "Activate".

    This endpoint blocks until confirmation that the Bond has executed
    (but not necessarily fulfilled)
    the Actions on all member Devices. Timeout shall be no more than 7 seconds.

    To check the resulting state, the client may query
    `/scenes/{scene_id}/state`, but the member Device and Group States
    are also updated.
